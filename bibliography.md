-   [stevens - 2012 - tcp ip illustrate volume 1 2nd edition][ste12]

    Extremely clear and exemplified.

    Gives due emphasis to the key points.

    Great first book.

-   [dostalek - 2006 - Understanding tcp ip][dos06]

    Explains the most important Internet protocol suite protocols deeply.

    Might not be the best first TCP IP book because it is a bit advanced, but it is a very good second one once you know the basics.
