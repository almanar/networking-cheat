## Wireless protocols

### 3GPP

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP>

Series of standards that include 2G, 3G, and 4G (a term which is disputed).

### LTE

### 4G

4G is only a marketing term.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_%28telecommunication%29>

Wide area.

Is an incompatible fork from the 3GPP 4G, causing confusion

### 3G

### UMTS

TODO

#### WCDMA

Part of UMTS?

### 2G

### GMS

TODO dates

### Wi-Fi

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance> defines it as the IEEE 802.11.XXX family of protocols.

So Wi-Fi is just a marketing term.

It is so dominant that people call WLAN Wi-Fi.

#### Wi-Fi Direct

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct>

Connect two computers directly through Wi-Fi without a router.

### Bluetooth

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth>

Initially IEEE 802.15.1, but no longer maintained by IEEE.

Less powerful than Wi-Fi, but less expensive / energy consuming.
