# TLS

Transport Layer Security.

Encrypts the entire TCP data.

## SSL

Predecessor of TLS.

## Implementations

Unlike TCP / IP, not implemented on the Kernel: <http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/60030/why-isnt-ssl-tls-built-into-modern-operating-systems> One of the reasons is that some countries, mostly dictatorships, regulate cryptography.

Major implementations include:

- OpenSSL. Likely the most popular. Will not be documented here.

### GnuTLS

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuTLS>

Created after OpenSSL because of GPL licensing.

Apparently, way less popular than OpenSSL and much more buggy: <http://www.zdnet.com/article/gnutls-big-internal-bugs-few-real-world-problems/>

Used by some important programs that need it for the GPL include LDAP and wget on Ubuntu 14.04.

## Network Security Services

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services>

Used by Mozilla.

## Apple SSL

Had a large breach, generated by a wrong C line that read `goto fail;` LOL <http://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-goto-fail-needs-a-massive-culture-change-to-fix/>
